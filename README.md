# TrenchCoat

TrenchCoat is a set of interlinked, very similar, programming languages: one high level and one low level, with the goal of being able to learn the high level language like you can Python, prototype and build things quickly with high levels of abstraction, but then go as low level as you need with the low level language, to get as much performace as possible. A project can be a combination of the 2 languages; in both, everything is statically typed, memory is done safely, concurrency is easy and the code compiles to something (hopefully, maybe) fast.

TrenchCoat is in it's infancy. Very very much so. You can see our aims [here](aims.md), the language spec [here](spec.md) or a nice document about concurrency [here](concurrency.md).
